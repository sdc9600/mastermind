# mastermind

Program that allows a human to play a computer at Mastermind.

Two ways to play:

Human codebreaker (The computer sets a code and the player has 12 turns to guess the code)
Computer codebreaker (Human player sets a code and the computer has 12 turns to guess it.)

When the human is the codebreaker te player is asked to proivde a 4-digit ordered string of the code. 
When this is provided the program will give out feedback in terms of black and white pegs regarding the players guess.

When the computer is the codebreaker the player is asked to set the code and then the computer will attempt to guess the given code.

Black peg means that the code has 'x' number of colours in the correct position, white pegs mean that the player has an 'x' number of colours in the incorrect position.

Note that if a black peg is given for a guess a white peg cannot also be given out for the same position of the code.
